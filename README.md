# Instructions

This is a test suite to help you get how to access and write data to nested data structures. You will solve the entire lab within `nested_spec.rb`.

It is all about being able to code the correct accessor levels / chains. Some of the examples will have you define local variables by replacing `__`, others will have you modify the data structure itself.
